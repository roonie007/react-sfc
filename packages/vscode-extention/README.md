# React SFC

Single File Components (SFC) for react with embedded scripts and styles, inspired by Vue SFC, but for React, with basic syntax highlighting ( for the moment ).

## Known Issues

The extension is still in development, and for the moment it only highlights the blocks, but it doesn't validate the code inside the blocks, nor it provides any kind of intellisense. ( I'm learning/working on it )
